# Creature Value Fetcher

This project is a **Creature Value Fetcher** built using Python and Tkinter. The application fetches values, demand, and price stability for creatures in the game *Creatures of Sonaria* from the [game.guide website](https://www.game.guide/) and displays the information in a user-friendly GUI.

Additionally, the application features an animated "mouse-to-lines connect" style background for a modern and engaging look.

## Features

- **Fetch Creature Data**: Retrieves the following information:
  - Creature Value (in Mush).
  - Player Demand (e.g., `5/10 Players`).
  - Price Stability (e.g., `STABLE`).
- **Animated Background**: Displays moving particles that connect dynamically to create a visually pleasing animation.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple input and output sections for quick access to creature data.
- **Trading Tips**: Provides tips based on the combined demand and stability to help users make trading decisions.
